A nebula is a vast cloud of interstellar gas and dust within a galaxy, typically illuminated by starlight or other radiation sources. Nebulae come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small, dense regions of gas and dust to massive, diffuse clouds that stretch across thousands of light-years. Some nebulae are the birthplace of new sun, while others are the remnants of stars that have died. Nebulae can be observed in different wavelengths, including visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared, which allows astronomers to study their properties and evolution.

## Types

Emission Nebulae: These are brightly glowing clouds of ionized gas, typically reddish or pinkish in color, that are often associated with young, hot stars. Examples include the famous Orion Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula.

Reflection Nebulae: These are clouds of dust that reflect the light of nearby stars, appearing blue in color. The most well-known example is the Pleiades star cluster.

Planetary Nebulae: These are shells of gas and dust ejected by a dying star in its final stages of life. Despite the name, they have nothing to do with planets. Examples include the Ring Nebula and the Helix Nebula.

Dark Nebulae: These are dense clouds of gas and dust that obscure the light of background stars, appearing as dark patches against the Milky Way. Examples include the Horsehead Nebula and the Pipe Nebula.

Supernova Remnants: These are the expanding shells of gas and dust left behind by a supernova explosion. Examples include the Crab Nebula and the Veil Nebula.

Molecular Clouds: These are the largest and most massive of all nebulae, consisting of cold, dense gas and dust that is the birthplace of new stars. Examples include the Taurus Molecular Cloud and the Orion Molecular Cloud.
