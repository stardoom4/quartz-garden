title: T∆S
---


In thermodynamics, T∆S represents the change in entropy (∆S) multiplied by the absolute temperature (T) of a system. It is a term that appears in the Gibbs free energy equation:

```
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
```

where ΔG is the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔH is the change in enthalpy, and T is the absolute temperature.

The T∆S term represents the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system at constant temperature and pressure. It is also related to the randomness or disorder of the system. When entropy increases, the T∆S term becomes more positive, and the system becomes more disordered.

The T∆S term is important because it determines whether a process is spontaneous or non-spontaneous. A spontaneous process is one that can occur without any external input, while a non-spontaneous process requires external input to occur. If ΔG is negative, then the process is spontaneous. If ΔG is positive, then the process is non-spontaneous.

The T∆S term is also important in understanding the efficiency of energy conversion processes. For example, the efficiency of a heat engine is limited by the T∆S term. This means that no heat engine can be 100% efficient, because some of the heat energy will always be lost as entropy.

In summary, T∆S is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that has important implications for the behavior of systems and the efficiency of energy conversion processes.
