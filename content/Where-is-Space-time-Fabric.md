title: Where is space time fabric
share: true

The term "spacetime fabric" is often used as a metaphor to describe the nature of spacetime in Einstein's general relativity, but it's important to understand that it's not a literal fabric:

Spacetime isn't a separate entity: It's not like a sheet or mesh that the universe exists within. Instead, it's a way of understanding how space and time are intertwined and influenced by matter and energy.
It's everywhere: Since spacetime is the framework for how everything exists, it encompasses the entire universe, from the tiniest particles to the largest galaxies. It's not something that has a specific location or boundary.
It's not static: Spacetime isn't fixed, but rather dynamic and constantly changing. The presence of matter and energy curves and warps its geometry, influencing how objects move and behave.
Therefore, saying that spacetime fabric "exists" everywhere might be confusing. It's more accurate to say that the concept of spacetime applies everywhere in the universe, and its properties change depending on the distribution of matter and energy.
